# PROJECT_NAME is the name of your project.
# LANGUAGES specifies the programming languages used (CXX for C++).

# The first argument is the name of your executable (e.g., MyExecutable).
# The subsequent arguments are the source files that make up this executable.

# (Optional) Link libraries if your executable depends on them
# Example: If you were using a math library
# target_link_libraries(MyExecutable PRIVATE YourMathLibrary)

# (Optional) Set output directory for executables/libraries (good practice)
# This places your build artifacts in a predictable location.
